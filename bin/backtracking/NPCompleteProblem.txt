- N queens problem : exponential running time with backtracking
- Coloring problem : exponential running time
- Sudoku problem : exponential running time
- Usually NP complete & NP hard problems are very slow to solve
- Solution is to find approximate solution than exact solution.

Meta-Heuristics:
- Usually for NP hard problems we are looking for approx solution then exact solution
- Methods: ant-colony optimization,genetic algo,simulated annealing
- Not always find the optimal solution(global minimum) BUT the algo will be fast
- THIS IS WHY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS IMPORTANT!!!!!
