 *Objective: Given two string sequences write an algorithm to find, find the length of longest substring present in both of them.
This problem has been asked in Amazon and Microsoft interviews. Approach to solve this problem will be slightly different than the approach in “Longest Common Subsequence”
What is Longest Common Substring: A longest substring is a sequence that appears in the same order and necessarily contiguous in both the strings.
Example:
String A = "tutorialhorizon";
String B = "dynamictutorialProgramming";
Output: Length of Longest Common Substring: 8 ("tutorial").
